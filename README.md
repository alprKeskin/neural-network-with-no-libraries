# neural-network-with-no-libraries
This is a Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) implementation. I did not use any kind of machine learning libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy etc. All tensor operations are implemented by me from scratch. I made use of only libraries such as math.

What I Implemented:

- Forward Pass in Neural Network (Multi-layer Perceptron)
- Backpropagation Algorithm in MLP
- All tensor operations from scratch as a Python Class


Note: Although the MLP I have implemented works without any errors, I have not completed my implementation yet. I will complete it as soon as possible. So, there might be problems such as exploding gradients or dying neuron problems etc.
